                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 table spoon butter melted</li>

                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
                </ol>
